```

### Step 3: Integrate Frontend Components (10 minutes)
```bash
# Components already created:

# Add routes to main App:
```

**Update `/src/App.tsx`**:
```typescript
import { PersonalLifeCoach } from './components/PersonalLifeCoach'
import { AIMediator } from './components/AIMediator'

// Add routes:
<Route path="/life-coach" element={<PersonalLifeCoach />} />
<Route path="/mediator" element={<AIMediator />} />
```

### Step 4: Test All Features (15 minutes)
```bash
# Start local dev server
pnpm dev

# Test URLs:
# http://localhost:5174/life-coach
# http://localhost:5174/mediator
# http://localhost:5174 (main strategy simulator)
```

**Test Scenarios**:
1. **Life Coach**: "Should I accept a $80K job offer or negotiate for $90K?"
2. **Mediator**: Landlord-tenant security deposit dispute ($500)
3. **Matching**: Join skill exchange market (offering: coding, seeking: Spanish)

### Step 5: Deploy to Production (5 minutes)
```bash
# Build production bundle
pnpm build

# Deploy (depends on your hosting)
# Vercel:
vercel deploy --prod

# Netlify:
netlify deploy --prod

# Or push to GitHub (if using GitHub Pages/Actions)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add 5 competition-winning innovations"
git push origin main
