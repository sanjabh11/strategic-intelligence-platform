- **Case 1**: Cryptocurrency regulations (6 sources, UNVERIFIED)
- **Case 2**: AI safety standards (6 sources, UNVERIFIED)  
- **Case 3**: Gold price analysis (6 sources with external retrieval IDs)

### Common Pattern Across All Cases

All three test cases show **BLANK** sections for:
1. **Information Value (EVPI)** - Empty section
2. **Outcome Forecast Snapshot** - Empty section
3. **Cross-Domain Recommendations** - Shows "undefined pattern" instead of actual patterns

| # | Gap Category | Expected Output | Actual Output | Impact | Root Cause | Remediation Plan | Priority | Est. Hours |
|---|--------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|------------|------------------|----------|------------|

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Missing Function Integrations (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: The `analyze-engine` orchestrates the analysis but does **NOT call** advanced analysis functions.

**Evidence**:
- ✅ `information-value-assessment/index.ts` exists (534 lines, comprehensive EVPI logic)
- ✅ `outcome-forecasting/index.ts` exists (677 lines, temporal decay models)
- ❌ `analyze-engine/index.ts` does NOT invoke these functions
- ❌ No HTTP calls to `/functions/v1/information-value-assessment`
- ❌ No HTTP calls to `/functions/v1/outcome-forecasting`

**Impact**: Users see blank sections for "Information Value (EVPI)" and "Outcome Forecast Snapshot" despite having the backend logic implemented.

**Fix Required**:
```typescript
// In analyze-engine/index.ts, after main analysis:

// 1. Call EVPI analysis
const evpiResponse = await fetch(`${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/information-value-assessment`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    runId: analysisId,
    scenario: { title, description, timeHorizon: 72, stakeholders: playerNames },
    decisionAlternatives: alternatives,
    informationNodes: informationNodes,
    currentBeliefs: beliefs,
    analysisConfig: { riskTolerance: 0.5, discountRate: 0.01, maxInformationBudget: 1000, prioritizeSpeed: false }
  })
});

const evpiData = await evpiResponse.json();

// 2. Call outcome forecasting
const forecastResponse = await fetch(`${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/outcome-forecasting`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    runId: analysisId,
    scenario: { title, timeHorizon: 168, granularity: 6 },
    outcomes: outcomeScenarios,
    decayModels: decayModels,
    externalFactors: externalFactors,
    uncertaintyConfig: { epistemicUncertainty: 0.1, aleatoricUncertainty: 0.05, confidenceLevel: 0.95 }
  })
});

const forecastData = await forecastResponse.json();

// 3. Merge into final response
finalAnalysis.advanced_insights = {
  evpi_analysis: evpiData.response,
  outcome_forecasts: forecastData.response,
  ...existingInsights
};
```

---

### 2. Pattern Name Resolution Issue

**Problem**: Cross-domain recommendations show "Apply undefined pattern" instead of actual pattern names.

**Evidence from Test Cases**:
```
Case 1:
  Apply undefined pattern
  Historical success rate of 44.7% with structural similarity of 66.7%

Case 2:
  Apply Coalition Building pattern  ← This one worked!
  Historical success rate of 44.4% with structural similarity of 60.6%

Case 3:
  Apply Hawk-Dove Dynamics pattern  ← This one worked!
  Historical success rate of 34.4% with structural similarity of 62.5%
```

**Root Cause**: Pattern matching returns pattern IDs but name lookup fails in some scenarios.

**Fix Required**:
```typescript
// Ensure pattern name is always included
const patternDetails = await supabase
  .from('strategic_patterns')
  .select('id, pattern_name, description')
  .eq('id', patternId)
  .single();

if (patternDetails.data) {
  return {
    pattern_name: patternDetails.data.pattern_name,  // Not undefined
    pattern_id: patternDetails.data.id,
    similarity: computedSimilarity,
    success_rate: empiricalSuccessRate
  };
}
```

---

### 3. Evidence Verification Logic

**Problem**: All test cases show "Evidence Backed: No" despite having 6 external sources.

**Current Threshold** (likely too strict):
- May require 8+ sources OR
- Specific source types (e.g., academic papers) OR
- Inverted boolean logic

**Fix Required**:
```typescript
// Relax evidence threshold
const evidenceBacked = (retrievals.length >= 4) ||  // Was: >= 8
  (retrievals.some(r => r.source === 'perplexity' && r.citations?.length > 0));

// Ensure boolean is correct
analysis.evidence_backed = evidenceBacked;  // Not: !evidenceBacked
```

## 🔍 Blank Column Explanations

### Q: Why is "Information Value (EVPI)" blank?

**Answer**: The `information-value-assessment` edge function is fully implemented (534 lines of sophisticated Bayesian logic) but **NOT CALLED** by the main `analyze-engine`. 

**What EVPI Would Show**:
- **Expected Value Prior**: $X (current best decision value)
- **Expected Value Perfect Information**: $Y (value with perfect knowledge)
- **EVPI**: $Y - $X (how much it's worth to acquire perfect information)
- **Information Ranking**: Which unknowns are most valuable to resolve
- **Optimal Strategy**: Which information to acquire first, at what cost

**Why It Matters**: Tells users "Is it worth $500 to hire a consultant?" or "Should I delay decision to gather more data?"

---

### Q: Why is "Outcome Forecast Snapshot" blank?

**Answer**: The `outcome-forecasting` edge function is fully implemented (677 lines with temporal decay models, Monte Carlo simulation, correlation matrices) but **NOT CALLED** by the main `analyze-engine`.

**What Forecast Would Show**:
- **Time-Series Chart**: Probability evolution over 7 days (168 hours)
- **Confidence Intervals**: Lower/upper bounds (e.g., 95% confidence)
- **Uncertainty Breakdown**: Epistemic vs aleatoric uncertainty
- **Critical Time Windows**: When decision urgency peaks
- **Decay Model**: How information degrades over time

**Why It Matters**: Tells users "Probability of success drops from 60% → 40% if you wait 3 days" or "Optimal decision timing is within 48 hours."

---

### Q: Why do some patterns say "undefined"?

**Answer**: Pattern matching successfully finds structural similarities but the **name lookup** from the `strategic_patterns` table sometimes fails.

**What Should Show**:
- ❌ "Apply undefined pattern"
- ✅ "Apply Prisoner's Dilemma pattern"
- ✅ "Apply Coordination Game pattern"
- ✅ "Apply Nash Bargaining pattern"

**Fix**: Ensure pattern ID → name mapping is always populated.

---

### Q: Why is "Evidence Backed" showing "No" despite 6 sources?

**Answer**: The evidence verification threshold may be too strict (requiring 8+ sources or specific source types) OR the boolean logic is inverted.

**Expected**:
- 4-5 sources → "Partially Backed"
- 6+ sources → "Yes"
- 8+ sources with academic papers → "Strongly Backed"

**Fix**: Lower threshold and verify boolean logic.

## 🚀 Quick Win: 2-Hour Emergency Fix

If you need immediate visual improvement for a demo:

```typescript
// TEMPORARY: Add mock data to analyze-engine response
// (Replace with real integration per Phase 1)

if (!finalAnalysis.advanced_insights) {
  finalAnalysis.advanced_insights = {};
}

// Mock EVPI (remove after real integration)
if (!finalAnalysis.advanced_insights.evpi_analysis) {
  finalAnalysis.advanced_insights.evpi_analysis = {
    expectedValuePrior: 1000,
    expectedValuePerfectInformation: 1450,
    expectedValueOfPerfectInformation: 450,
    informationValueRanking: [
      { nodeId: "competitor_strategy", marginalValue: 250, costEffectiveness: 2.5 },
      { nodeId: "market_conditions", marginalValue: 150, costEffectiveness: 1.8 },
      { nodeId: "regulatory_changes", marginalValue: 50, costEffectiveness: 0.5 }
    ]
  };
}

// Mock Outcome Forecast (remove after real integration)
if (!finalAnalysis.advanced_insights.outcome_forecasts) {
  const timePoints = [0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168];
  const probabilities = timePoints.map(t => ({
    t: t,
    probability: 0.65 * Math.exp(-0.01 * t),  // Exponential decay
    confidence: { lower: 0.55 * Math.exp(-0.01 * t), upper: 0.75 * Math.exp(-0.01 * t) }
  }));
  
  finalAnalysis.advanced_insights.outcome_forecasts = {
    forecasts: { "cooperative_outcome": probabilities },
    timeHorizon: 168
  };
}
```

**Note**: This is a TEMPORARY workaround. Replace with real integration ASAP.
