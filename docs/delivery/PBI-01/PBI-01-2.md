# PBI-01-2 Integrate local engine into useStrategyAnalysis

## Description
Short-circuit network calls by using the local engine when `mode === 'education_quick'` or `VITE_LOCAL_ANALYZE=true`.

## Status History

## Requirements
- Import and call `analyzeLocally()` when local mode is enabled or quick mode is selected.
- Validate the local result via Zod `AnalysisResultSchema` before setting state.

## Implementation Plan
- Update `src/hooks/useStrategyAnalysis.ts` to import `isLocalMode` and `analyzeLocally` and branch accordingly.

## Test Plan
- Run with `VITE_LOCAL_ANALYZE=true` and verify immediate results render without backend.

## Verification
- Build successful; pending manual smoke test.

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useStrategyAnalysis.ts`
