# PBI-06-2 Add quantum influence heatmap

## Description
Visualize `analysis.quantum.influence` as a heatmap under the Quantum section in `StrategySimulator`. This conveys inter-player influence strength.

## Status History
- 2025-08-26T00:00:00Z | user_approves | Proposed -> Agreed | Proceed with heatmap visualization. | User
- 2025-08-26T00:03:00Z | start_work | Agreed -> InProgress | Implementing influence heatmap in QuantumChart. | AI_Agent
- 2025-08-26T00:05:00Z | submit_for_review | InProgress -> Review | Added heatmap, labels, color scale; build successful. | AI_Agent

## Requirements
- If `analysis.quantum.influence` is a 2D number matrix, render a labeled grid.
- Color scale from low (blue) to high (red); robust against constant matrices.
- Row/column labels default to player names (or ids), fallback P1..Pn.
- Fully responsive and scrollable if wide.

## Implementation Plan
- Extend `QuantumChart` in `src/components/StrategySimulator.tsx`.
- Compute min/max and normalize for color mapping.
- Render headers and cells as a CSS grid.

## Test Plan
- Build and load a sample analysis where `quantum.influence` is provided.
- Verify no runtime errors when matrix missing or empty; heatmap hidden.
- Verify tooltip/title shows cell coordinates and value with 3 decimals.

## Verification
- Pending build and manual smoke test.

## Files Modified
- `src/components/StrategySimulator.tsx`
