# PBI-06: Frontend Enhancements

## Overview
Enhance the frontend to improve interpretability and robustness by:
- Displaying `equilibrium.convergenceIteration`.
- Visualizing `quantum.influence` as a heatmap.
- Validating API responses with Zod to prevent UI crashes on malformed data.

## Problem Statement
Users need clearer signals of algorithmic behavior (convergence) and interaction structure (influence matrix), and the UI must be resilient to partial/malformed backend responses.

## User Stories
- As an analyst, I want to see convergence iteration so I can gauge solution stability and runtime.
- As a researcher, I want to see influence between players to understand interdependencies.
- As a user, I want the UI to validate and gracefully handle backend response errors.

## Technical Approach
- Update `src/components/StrategySimulator.tsx` to render `convergenceIteration` and an influence heatmap under Quantum section.
- Add Zod schemas in `src/hooks/useStrategyAnalysis.ts` to validate responses from `analyze-engine` and `get-analysis-status` before updating state.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Convergence iteration appears when provided.
- Influence heatmap appears when `analysis.quantum.influence` is provided; no runtime errors if absent.
- Invalid responses trigger user-friendly error and do not crash the app.

## Dependencies
- Zod (already in dependencies).

## Open Questions
- Influence matrix semantics (players vs actions) and labeling scheme; initial version uses generic P1..Pn labels pending backend spec.

## Related Tasks
- See tasks index for PBI-06 (`docs/delivery/PBI-06/tasks.md`).
