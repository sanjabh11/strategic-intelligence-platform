## ⚠️ Critical Decisions

### ✅ BUILD (High ROI, Low Risk)
1. Geopolitical Simulator Dashboard
2. Bias Intervention Simulator (web-based, NO AR)
3. Web Multiplayer Games (web-based, NO VR)

### ⛔ DO NOT BUILD (Low ROI, High Risk)
4. DAO Voting (over-engineering, 1.67x ROI)
5. Prediction Markets (legal risk, 0.6x ROI)
6. AR Overlays (30+ days, limited value)
7. VR Tournaments (60+ days, accessibility issues)

### 🤔 Rationale for Skipping AR/VR

**AR Overlays** (Feature #2):
- Requires native mobile app (iOS + Android)
- 30+ days of development
- Limited to users with modern smartphones
- No clear advantage over web-based learning
- Can be added in Phase 4 if platform scales to 100K+ users

**VR Tournaments** (Feature #4):
- Requires Unity/Unreal development
- 60+ days of development
- Requires VR headsets ($300-$1000)
- Limits accessibility to wealthy users
- Web-based multiplayer achieves 90% of value in 5 days

**Better Approach**: Build excellent web experiences first. Add AR/VR later if demand exists.

## 📋 Implementation Strategy

### 80/20 Rule Applied
- **20% effort** (frontend development)
- **80% value** (leverage existing backend)
- **Focus**: High-ROI features only
- **Result**: Maximum impact, minimum complexity

### Phased Rollout
1. **Week 1**: Soft launch (Geopolitical Dashboard)
2. **Week 2**: Beta launch (+ Bias Simulator)
3. **Week 3**: Full launch (+ Multiplayer)

### Quality Checkpoints
- End of Week 1: Demo dashboard
- End of Week 2: Demo bias training
- End of Week 3: Demo multiplayer

### Fallback Plans
- **Week 1 delay**: Cut historical comparison
- **Week 2 delay**: Reduce to 5 scenarios
- **Week 3 delay**: Launch with 2 games
