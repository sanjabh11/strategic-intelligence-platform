- ‚úÖ TESTED AND VERIFIED WORKING

// Database: matching_participants, matches tables (EXIST)
```

### Value-Add Rating: **2.5/5.0** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Why Lower Value**:
- ‚úÖ Core matching already excellent (Nobel Prize algorithms)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è DAO voting is **overkill** for a learning platform
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockchain integration is 15+ days (violates 80/20 rule)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Adds complexity without clear educational benefit
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not aligned with "learning platform" mission

**What It Adds**:
- Community governance (but who's the community for an education platform?)
- On-chain voting (expensive, slow, complex)
- Decentralization (not needed for teaching game theory)

**What It Doesn't Add**:
- No improvement to matching quality (already optimal)
- No educational value (students don't care about DAOs)
- No research value (researchers want algorithms, not governance)

### 80/20 Analysis: **LOW PRIORITY** ‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

**Recommendation**: **SKIP THIS FEATURE** ‚ùå

**Reasoning**:
- Current matching markets are already production-ready
