## 📊 Key Findings Summary

### ✅ Top 3 Features (BUILD)
1. **Geopolitical Simulator** - 5 days, 9.0x ROI
2. **Bias Simulator (no AR)** - 4 days, 8.75x ROI
3. **Web Multiplayer (no VR)** - 5 days, 6.0x ROI

**Total**: 14 days, 7.92x average ROI

---

### ⛔ Rejected Features (SKIP)
4. **DAO Voting** - 15 days, 1.67x ROI (over-engineering)
5. **Prediction Markets** - 25+ days, 0.6x ROI (legal risk)

**Avoided**: 40+ days of low-value work

---

### 🔮 Phase 4 Features (DEFER)
- **AR Overlays** - 30+ days (requires mobile app)
- **VR Tournaments** - 60+ days (requires VR development)

**Deferred**: 90+ days, can add later if demand exists
